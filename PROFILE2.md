Hello!
🙋‍♂‍ My name is Pedro, I am 27 years old, born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil.
🎓 I have a civil engineering degree from Poli-USP, and during my time in college I had the opportunity to, along with some friends, found an extension group called "Concreto Poli"
💼 For my professional career, I am currently working in a Venture Capital firm that invests in early-stage startups.
📗 In my spare time, I love reading books about various subjects, but especially about human behavior, leadership, and finance. I'm also avid for sports, being part of my daily routine since I can remember.
💻 Finally, rooting from my academic and professional background, my interest for technology and its applications have grown over the past years, which led me to continue my studies about programming, more spefically on the data science field.
